# web-scraping-challenge

The purpose of the challenge is to display the ability to web-scrape a website to obtain and store data. As well as use pandas to convert data to a HTML string and store it as a dictionary.

Using the data obtained, the other part of the challenge was to create a HTML page that displays the data and contains a button that 'scrapes' the information.

The information that was obtained came from four different sites and were: the latest article with its brief paragraph, a featured image, and a table with data. 

The tools used were splinter, BeautifulSoup, ChromeDriverManager, pandas, flask, and MongoDB.
